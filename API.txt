API care recommendations
Like any other things you are using, the API requires some attention. 
To let it serve you properly, we suggest that you carefully read these instructions and care recommendations.

First, we recommend always call API no more than one time for every 10 minutes for one location, 
however you call it by city, geographical coordinates or by zip code. 
Our weather model is not updated more frequently than one time per about 10 minutes.

Second, use only this endpoint for calling Free API: api.openweathermap.org. 
Please, never use the IP address of the server. The endpoint for premium subscriptions is different; 
it can be found in the confirmation email we sent you right after your subscription is activated.

Third, to get a precise geocoding searching result would rather call API by city ID. You can always call API by city name, city coordinates or zip code but the searching result might be a bit less unambiguous. The list of city IDs is here.

Forth, last but not least, mind that our subscriptions all have limited availability. 
The more premium is your subscription the more available is service. 
If you do not receive a response from the API due to this limitation, 
please, wait at least for 10 min and then repeat your request. 
We recommend you keeping the most recent request without changes, 
it helps to use our internal caching service properly
